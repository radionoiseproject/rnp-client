Radio Noise Project (web interface)
===================================

This is the main client for the Radio Noise Project, implemented in
HTML and JavaScript. It is intended to be hosted from a static web server.

To Build
--------

At some point we'll probably have a build system here that fetches js libraries,
builds stylesheets, etc. Until then there's nothing to do here.

To Serve
--------

Serve the directory `/pub` somewhere with a good static webserver. May I
recommend [nginx](http://nginx.org/)?
